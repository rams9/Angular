OnInit and OnDestroy

ngOnInit : this lifecycle hook is executed after the components constructer method and is a good place to perform initial setup for the component.

ngOnDestroy: this lifecycle hook is executed just before the component is destroyed and is a good place to perform cleanup operations for the component 


difference between constructer and NgOninit is when we are passing input to component constructer can't get the value of input
@input in child component if tried to access in constructer it is undefined.


ngOnChanges : This lifecycle hook is executed whenever the components @input properties change. and when component construction time before ngOnInit it will trigger.
